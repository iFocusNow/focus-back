# Springboot Docker template

### Getting started

#### Installation

Install Maven (mvn), Docker and Java in your computer.
Run the following without error to check if all your your versions are alright:
```
java -version
mvn -v
docker -v
```

#### Dockerfile and Docker-compose
Make sure to change the name of your Dockerfile application (demo to whatever your application may be).
Before running anything in Docker, make sure your application runs correctly. I left some useful application properties in resources, so you can change them as you wish. After that, run the following to repackage your project:
```
mvn package spring-boot:repackage
```
This will generate a .jar file in your package folder.

Now, you can run the docker-compose as follows in the terminal:
```
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml up
```
If both containers are running fine and without errors, then you can check localhost:8080 or connect your database to a database manager.
